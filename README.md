Candidate Elimination Algorithm with Streamlit
Description
This Streamlit application implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm, a machine learning algorithm used for concept learning in the context of supervised learning. The algorithm is demonstrated using a simple dataset uploaded by the user in CSV format.

Features
Allows users to upload their own training data in CSV format.
Implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm to generate the final hypotheses.
Displays the final specific and general hypotheses.
Usage
Upload Training Data: Click on the "Upload Training Data" section on the sidebar and choose a CSV file containing the training data.
View Training Data: Once uploaded, the application displays the uploaded training data.
Final Hypotheses: After processing the data, the application presents the final specific and general hypotheses generated by the Candidate Elimination algorithm.
