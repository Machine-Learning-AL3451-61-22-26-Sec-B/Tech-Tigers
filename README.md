# Candidate Elimination Algorithm with Streamlit

## Description
This Streamlit application implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm, a machine learning algorithm used for concept learning in the context of supervised learning. The algorithm is demonstrated using a simple dataset uploaded by the user in CSV format.

## Features
- Allows users to upload their own training data in CSV format.
- Implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm to generate the final hypotheses.
- Displays the final specific and general hypotheses.

## Usage
1. **Upload Training Data**: Click on the "Upload Training Data" section on the sidebar and choose a CSV file containing the training data.
2. **View Training Data**: Once uploaded, the application displays the uploaded training data.
3. **Final Hypotheses**: After processing the data, the application presents the final specific and general hypotheses generated by the Candidate Elimination algorithm.
